synopsis: "Public Key Infrastructure purely in OCaml"
description: """
X.509 is a public key infrastructure used mostly on the Internet.  It consists
of certificates which include public keys and identifiers, signed by an
authority.  Authorities must be exchanged over a second channel to establish the
trust relationship.  This library implements most parts of
[RFC5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) and
[RFC6125](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125).
